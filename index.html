            <h1>Kenya's Great Wildebeest Migration</h1>
            <p>The Great Wildebeest Migration is one of the most awe-inspiring wildlife events on Earth. Every year, over 1.5 million wildebeest, along with hundreds of thousands of zebras and gazelles, embark on an 800-kilometer journey between the Serengeti (Tanzania) and the Maasai Mara (Kenya).</p>

                <h2>What are Wildebeest?</h2>
                <p>Wildebeest (also called gnus) are large antelopes native to East and Southern Africa. They have stocky bodies, curved horns, and shaggy manes, and survive by grazing on short grasses, which forces them to move constantly.</p>
                <p>Comprising 90% of the migrating herds, wildebeest are followed by zebras and gazelles. Their massive numbers attract predators such as lions, hyenas, and crocodiles, turning the migration into a high-stakes struggle for survival.</p>

                    <h2>Why Do Wildebeest Migrate?</h2>
                    <p>The Great Migration is the annual movement of over a million wildebeest from Tanzania’s Serengeti northward into Kenya’s adjoining Maasai Mara National Reserve. Guided by primal instinct, the herds follow rainfall patterns across the Serengeti-Maasai Mara ecosystem, chasing greener pastures..</p> 
                    <p>This never-ending cycle is driven by four key factors: </p>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>The search for fresh grass - wildebeest follow the rains, which trigger new grass growth (their primary food source).</li>
                        <li>Water sources - They must drink regularly, migrating toward rivers and seasonal waterholes.
                        <li>Survival instinct - staying in one place would deplete food and increase disease risk.</li>
                        <li>Reproduction cycle - Calving seasons are timed with safer grazing areas.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The migration peaks with dramatic river crossings, where thousands plunge into crocodile-infested waters.</p>

                    <p>Predators target the weak, turning these moments into a life-or-death struggle, not just a journey, but a battle for survival shaped by instinct, weather, and scarce resources.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>The wildebeest's endless journey cycles between Tanzania's Serengeti and Kenya's Masai Mara year-round, offering ever-changing wildlife spectacles with each season. The most awe-inspiring event, the dramatic Mara River crossings, unfolds during peak safari months (July-October), when massive herds brave crocodile-infested waters in a heart-stopping battle for survival..</p>
